Loop 38:
   The active site loop, containing residue 38.

Loop 200:
   The turn in the opposite monomer that contacts the active site loop.  In the 
   wildtype structure this turn goes from residues 199-202, but this will 
   change as residues are added or removed from the structure.  I just use 200 
   because it's a round number that's easy to remember, and kinda in the middle 
   so it'll still be part of the turn even if one or two residues are inserted 
   or deleted.
