Materials:
- 137 mL Sepharose CL-6B slurry
- 2.05 g EDAC
- 11.5 mL ethylenediamine
- 500 mL acetone
- 214 mg 1,1-carbonyldiimidizole (CDI)
- 1.64 g sodium deoxycholate
- 70 mL 1,4-dioxane

Procedure:
1.  Wash 137 mL of sepharose with distilled water, 
    7:3 W:Acetone, 3:7 W:Acetone, 100% Acetone 
    successively, approximately one volume of each.  
    (use a Buchner funnel or similar for washing)

2.  Resuspend resin in acetone, and add 214 mg of CDI 
    in 5 mL acetone.  Stir (by rotation) for 15 
    minutes before washing with acetone (1-2 volumes)

3.  Dissolve 11.5 mL ethylenediamine in 137 mL water.  
    Change pH to 10 using NaOH/HCl as needed (check 
    with pH paper, not meter â€“ I needed ~5 mL 
    concentrated HCl)

4.  Add this solution to the activated resin, let 
    react for 15 minutes as before.

5.  Wash with 500 mL each of water, 1 M NaCl and 
    water again.

6.  Dissolve 1.64 g sodium deoxycholate (use the 
    sodium salt, as it is much more soluble; could 
    also use deoxycholic acid + NaOH to generate the 
    sodium salt) in 137 mL 50% dioxane/water

7.  Add 2.05 g EDAC to this solution

8.  Add solution to the resin

9.  Rotate 24 hours at room temperature

10. Wash with ~1.5 L 40 mM potassium phosphate pH 7, 
    until you stop seeing foam 
    in the wash (gotten rid of the free deoxycholate)

Notes
=====
Essentially this is coupling an amine linker to the 
sepharose, and then coupling deoxycholate to the 
amine.
