Growth & induction
==================
0. Inoculate 3 mL LB + Carb cultures with 3 µL o/n.

1. Grow at 37 and start checking the OD after about 
   2-3 hours (earlier is safer since it'll overshoot 
   quickly). Wait until it hits about 0.6. 

2. When the OD reachers ~0.6, could you do me a favor 
   and make a glycerol stock? I should have 50% 
   glycerol on my bench in a 50 mL falcon tube. Just 
   make a 50/50 mix of cells and 50% glycerol (25% 
   final) in a cryotube for each mutant. 

3. At OD 0.6, induce with 500 uM IPTG (1.5 µL 1M 
   IPTG) and move to 18°C.  Incubate overnight.

Lysis
=====
1. Spin down the culture in 1.6 mL microcentrifuge 
   tubes (you'll probably have to split each mutant 
   into two tubes). 

2. Make a 1x solution (10-fold dilution into water) 
   of BugBuster. The BugBuster is on my bench, and 
   the manual is attached just in case.

3. Add 500 uL 1x BugBuster to each pellet. If you 
   split the cells in step 1, you can add 500 uL to 
   one of the tubes, then transfer it to resuspend 
   the other tube. 

4. Incubate at RT for 10-20 minutes. 

5. Spin at 16000 x g for 20 min at 4C. 

6. Save the supernatent in a new tube, and resuspend 
   the pellet in 500 uL water 

Gel
===
1. Prepare the Laemmli reagent; take 450 uL of the 
   Laemmli reagent (blue loading dye) and add 50 uL 
   beta-mercaptoethanol. You can ask Chris for the 
   loading dye if you don't have any (I think I just 
   ran out). 

2. Dilute soluble and insoluble lysate fractions 
   10-fold in water. 

3. In PCR tubes, mix 5 uL of your loading buffer with 
   15 uL diluted sample. 

4. Grab 1 uL of pure WT KSI, which is in the large 
   fridge on my shelf in a 50 mL falcon tube, and mix 
   it with 5 uL loading buffer and 14 uL water. 

5. Incubate these at 95C for 10 minutes. 

6. Load samples + ladder on a 12-lane 4-15% gel (not 
   100% sure about the percentages but you should use 
   the gradient gel, not the pure 10% gel). 

7. Run at ~180 volts for 30 minutes, or until the dye 
   reaches the edge. 

8. The Coommassie is on my bench. 

Staining
========
1. Rinse the gel a few times in nanopure water

2. Submerge gel once again in water, then microwave 
   for 1 minute

3. Wait 1-2 minutes

4. Drain water and add Coommassie. Microwave for 1 
   minutes. 

5. The longer you wait here the better, but with the 
   microwave protocol you should only need ~10 
   minutes. 

6. Drain Coommassie into the "Used Commassie" 
   container, then rinse the gel a few times in 
   nanopure water. 

7. Add destaining solution. If you want to see the 
   results quickly, microwave for a minute, wait a 
   while (10 minutes), then drain into the methanol 
   waste and add more destaining solution; otherwise, 
   leave overnight. You can also take a kim wipe and 
   tie it up and place it in with your gel, but this 
   can cause uneven destaining if it has too much 
   contact with the gel.
