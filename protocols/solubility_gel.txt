Growth & induction
==================
1. Inoculate 3 mL cultures (LB + Carb) with 3 µL 
   overnight culture.

2. Grow at 37°C and start checking the OD after about 
   2-3 hours (earlier is safer since it'll overshoot 
   quickly).

3. At OD600=0.6, induce with 500 µM IPTG (1.5 µL 1M 
   IPTG).
   
4. Lower temperature to 18°C and incubate overnight.

Lysis
=====
1. Spin down the culture in 1.6 mL microcentrifuge 
   tubes (you'll probably have to split each mutant 
   into two tubes). 

2. Make a 1x solution (10-fold dilution into water) 
   of BugBuster.

3. Add 500 uL 1x BugBuster to each pellet. If you 
   split the cells in step 1, you can add 500 uL to 
   one of the tubes, then transfer it to resuspend 
   the other tube. 

4. Incubate at room temperature for 10-20 minutes. 

5. Pellet the lysate (16,000g; 20 min; 4°C).

6. Save the supernatant in a clean tube; resuspend 
   the pellet in 500 µL water.

Gel
===
1. Prepare the Laemmli reagent
  - 450 µL Laemmli reagent (blue loading dye)
  - 50 µL β-mercaptoethanol

2. Dilute soluble and insoluble lysate fractions 
   10-fold in water. 

3. In PCR tubes, mix 5 uL of your loading buffer with 
   15 uL diluted sample. 

4. Grab 1 uL of pure WT KSI, which is in the large 
   fridge on my shelf in a 50 mL falcon tube, and mix 
   it with 5 uL loading buffer and 14 uL water. 

5. Incubate these at 95°C for 10 min. 

6. Load the samples (and a ladder) on a 12-lane 4-20% 
   Tris-glycine PAGE gel. 

7. Run at ~180V for 30 min, or until the dye 
   reaches the edge. 

Staining
========
1. Rinse the gel a few times in nanopure water

2. Submerge gel once again in water, then microwave 
   for 1 minute

3. Wait 1-2 minutes

4. Drain water and add Coommassie. Microwave for 1 
   minutes. 

5. The longer you wait here the better, but with the 
   microwave protocol you should only need ~10 
   minutes. 

6. Drain Coommassie into the "Used Commassie" 
   container, then rinse the gel a few times in 
   nanopure water. 

7. Add destaining solution. If you want to see the 
   results quickly, microwave for a minute, wait a 
   while (10 minutes), then drain into the methanol 
   waste and add more destaining solution; otherwise, 
   leave overnight. You can also take a kim wipe and 
   tie it up and place it in with your gel, but this 
   can cause uneven destaining if it has too much 
   contact with the gel.
