E. Check purity by 15% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE
--------------------------------------------
Typical lanes (heat all samples at 95°C/5 min before 
loading, except marker):
a. MW marker
b. Pre-induction
    i. Centrifuge 1 mL cells aliquot at 
       14,000g/5'/4°C.
    ii. Resuspend cells in 100 uL of 5x SB, and heat 
        at 95 C for 5 min
    iii. Load 10 uL of resuspended cells
c. Post-induction: Prepare sample same as above.  
   Load 10 uL.
d. Lysate supernatant
    i.   Centrifuge 100 uL cell lysate at 
         14,000g/5'/4°C.
    ii.  Transfer 100 uL of supernatant into fresh 
         eppendorff tube.
    iii. Load 5 uL of this supernatant + 5 uL 5x SB.
e. Lysate pellet
    i.   Resuspend pellet from part (d) above in 100 
         uL of 20 mM NaPi, 7 M urea, pH 7.2 (or any 
         high urea buffer)
    ii.  Load 5 uL of this suspension + 5 uL 5x SB.
f. 1% DOC wash: Load 5 uL of DOC wash + 5 uL 5x SB.
g. Refolded enzyme, before affinity step: Load 15 uL 
   + 5 uL 5x SB (note large loading volume due to 
   huge dilution here).
h. Affinity flowthrough: Load 15 uL + 5 uL 5x SB 
   (again note large loading volume).
i. Final protein
    i.   If quantitated by UV/Vis, loading 10 uL of 
         50-100 uM pure protein solution (0.5-1.0 
         nmol) should be more than sufficient to see 
         plenty of material by Coomassie without 
         drastic overloading for a 10-lane gel. 
         Adjust volume accordingly for higher 
         concentrations.
    ii.  If not yet quantitated, 1-5 mM pure protein 
         solution after final concentration step is 
         typical.  Loading 1 uL of 1 mM solution 
         should more than suffice, and loading 1 uL 
         of 2 mM or greater solutions can result in 
         noticeable overloading of lanes. For a 
         publication quality gel, it is probably best 
         to quantify amount of protein first
