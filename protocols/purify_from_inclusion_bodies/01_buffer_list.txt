Buffer List
-----------
Store all buffers at 4째C except #6.  #6 is a 
supersaturated urea solution at 4째C, so keep it at 
room temperature to prevent the urea from crashing 
out.  Bring #6 to 4째C the night before use.

1. 40 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 25% sucrose w/v, pH 8.5 

   Amount needed per design:
   10 mL

   Recipe for 1L:
   10 mL 1M Tris HCl
   2 mL 0.5M EDTA
   250 g sucrose

2. 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate w/v, 200 mM 
   NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.5

   Amount needed per design:
   25 mL

   Recipe for 1L:
   20 mL 1M Tris HCl
   40 mL 5M NaCl
   4 mL 0.5M EDTA
   10 g sodium deoxycholate

3. 10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, pH 8.5

   Amount needed per design:
   25 mL

   Recipe for 1L:
   10 mL 1M Tris HCl
   2.5 g sodium deoxycholate

4. 20 mM Na-HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.5

   Amount needed per design:
   25 mL

   Recipe for 1L:
   5.205g Na HEPES
   100 mL 5M NaCl
   2 mL 0.5M EDTA

5. 8 M urea, 20 mM Na-HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 
   (10 mM DTT just before use), pH 8.5

   Amount needed per design:
   10 mL

   Recipe for 1L:
   480.48 g urea
   5.206 g Na HEPES
   100 mL 5M NaCl
   2 mL 0.5M EDTA

   Dissolving urea in water is very endothermic and 
   urea becomes less soluble at lower temperatures, 
   so you need to gently heat this buffer while 
   stirring.  Use a glass 1L beaker, because the 
   plastic one could melt.  Heat to ~55째C: enough to 
   keep the buffer from getting too cold but not 
   enough to really heat it up.

6. 40 mM KPi, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, pH 7.2

   Amount needed per design:
   210 mL + 50 mL per column

   Recipe for 1L:
   5.444 g potassium phosphate monobasic
   2 mL 0.5 M EDTA
   2 mL 1M DTT

7. 400 mM KPi, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, pH 7.2

   Amount needed per design:
   100 mL per column

   Recipe for 1L:
   54.44 g potassium phosphate monobasic
   2 mL 0.5 M EDTA
   2 mL 1M DTT

   Note that it's hard to dissolve this much KPi.  
   Expect to have to stir vigorously for a while.

8. 40 mM KPi, 1 mM EDTA, 50% EtOH, 2 mM DTT, pH 7.2

   Amount needed per design:
   25 mL per column

   Recipe for 1L:
   5.444 g potassium phosphate monobasic
   2 mL 0.5 M EDTA
   2 mL 1M DTT
   500 mL EtOH

   KPi is not very soluble in EtOH, so this buffer 
   also takes a long time to dissolve.

9. 40% EtOH, 24 mM KPi

   Amount needed per design:
   20 mL per column

   Recipe for 1L:
   400 mL EtOH
   240 mL 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.2
