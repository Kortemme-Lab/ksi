Purify KSI from inclusion bodies
================================
All steps to be at 4 C, unless otherwise stated.
Values given here are for 2 L large cultures. Scale 
for larger scale preps if needed.

A. Express designs
------------------
1. Make a 50 mL overnight culture.  Use 50 mL LB and 
   50 ug/mL (25 μL of 100 mg/mL) carbenicillin.
2. Start 2 1L cultures from the overnight culture.  
   For each culture, use:
    - 1L LB
    - 10 mL overnight culture (1:100 dilution)
    - 50 μg/mL carbenicillin (500 μL of 100 mg/μL)
3. Grow to an O.D. of 0.6 (~2 hours) at 37°C.  Remove 
   1 mL aliquot of cells for SDS-PAGE.
4. Induce with 0.5 mL 1M IPTG in each 1L culture 
   (final IPTG concentration: 0.5 mM).
5. Grow another 3-4 hours, then remove 1 mL aliquot 
   of cells for SDS-PAGE.
6. Harvest cells by centrifugation (3500 rpm/20'/4°C)
7. Resuspend in 10-15 mL of buffer #1.  Remove 100 μL 
   aliquot for SDS-PAGE.
8. Freeze at -20°C to preserve for ~1 week or at 
   -80°C to preserve for longer than that.
