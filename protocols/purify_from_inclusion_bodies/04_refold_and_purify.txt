C. Solubilize inclusion bodies & refold enzyme
----------------------------------------------
1. Add 10 mL buffer #5 with fresh DTT (100 uL 1M 
   DTT).  Shake for 30' at 4°C to dissolve.
2. Centrifuge at 20,000 rpm/20'/4°C.
3. Add supernatant to 200 mL buffer #6 to bring the 
   urea concentration down to 400 mM.  Stir for 1h.
4. Filter with 0.4 um filter (can use 250 mL filter 
   bottle, or syringes).  If filtering is too hard,
   you may need to centrifuge at 20,000g/20'/4°C to 
   remove most of the precipitate.
5. Save 100 uL aliquot of refolded material for 
   SDS-PAGE.
6. Pre-equilibrate 5-10 mL deoxycholate affinity 
   column with buffer #6.
7. Apply filtered refolded enzyme to deoxycholate 
   column by gravity at 4°C.  Save 100 uL aliquot of 
   flow-through for SDS-PAGE.
8. Wash with 100 mL buffer #7.  Use a syringe or a 
   vacuum to force the wash through the column.
9. Wash with 50 mL buffer #6.  Use a syringe or a 
   vacuum to force the wash through the column.
10. Elute with 25 mL buffer #8.  Collect ~3 mL 
    fractions.
11. Check for fraction that contain protein using a 
    mini-Bradford assay and pool those fractions that 
    do.  Bring pooled volume to 6 mL by adding buffer 
    #8 if necessary.
12. Load on superose 12 size exclusion column:
    a. Isocratic 1 mL/min 40 mM KPi, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM 
       DTT
    b. 6 mL injection
    c. 128 mL total flow
    d. Collect 2 mL fractions after 40 min (so after 
       40 mL flowthrough).
13. Pool fractions containing protein (by 
    absorbance).
14. Concentrate in Amicon Ultra 10 kDa cutoff spin 
    filter units at 3500 rpm/20'/4°C.
15. Store concentrated enzyme at 4°C.
